# eXpOS NITC OS Lab

Repo contains the project files of the Experimental Operating System as a part of the OS Lab Course I took in Sem 4 at NITC

## Foreword

Stage 1-15 was easy to implement but stage 16 onwards got harder and harder. Stage 21 and 22 were especially annoying with stage 27 being kind of painful when you realise errors from last month are causing bugs. Stage 26 is my favourite, very demure and very mindful and doesnt affect the other code much.

Stage 28 is bad considering the installation breaks on my version of MintOS and I tried fixing the lex errors while compiling but it was fruitless. Ended up with a broken nespl, an nexfs-interface which only loads the code once to nexm since nexms disk isnt being loaded properly even when fdisk is run. All in, very annoying. Maybe even the worst stage in the history of stages, possibly ever.

* Stage 28 - [Multi-core extension](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/roadmap/stage-28/) - *parlial implementation due to buggy startfiles*

### Additions

* compile_script.sh - Script which when placed in the myexpos or mynexpos directory and run will compile every expl and spl code file. Updating the file path is necessary.
* batch.xfs - Every stage has its own batch file which has the necessary commands to load the end product of the stage.

## Hazards

* Some earlier stages may not work as intended if run in the commit of a further stage. For best results, checkout stage completion commit of the stage to be run.
